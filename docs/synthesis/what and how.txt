Economical Decision-Making
"neurobiological and computational mechanisms of complex planning in navigation"

    MAIN TARGETS
        uncertainty
            pdf estimation
        economics
            explotation/exploration trade-off
        conditioning
            repetition of decisions with less RT (egocentric navigation)
        perception
            visual shortest path processing (allocentric navigation)
            visual exploration
        memory
            a priori knowledge for a line (intermap transfer)
            short-term memory limits
        motivation
        logic
            switching between strategies
            find strategy elements
    
    MODEL ANALYSIS
        work ALWAYS with subjects history.
        models can fit people behaviour temporally
    
    OBSERVATIONS
        we can allow random maps/trials
        
        with what will we work? (eeg/fmri/eyetracker)
        
        models can work without feedback from their decisions. why? because they already follow a kind of logic. that means that they learn the estimation, but cannot learn to decide. logic is how you decide. having the knowledge and understanding when your logic is good or wrong, you can learn to decide, too. you sometimes learn which strategies are the best.
        so, models can fit people behaviour temporally. check that.
        
    ADVANTAGES
        ecological
        we can follow serial decisions. as in the n-bandit task
